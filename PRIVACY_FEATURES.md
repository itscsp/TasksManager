# Task Privacy Features

## Overview
The WordPress Tasks Manager plugin now implements comprehensive privacy controls to ensure that each user can only access and modify their own tasks. **ALL tasks are now created with 'private' status for maximum privacy.**

## Privacy Implementation

### 1. Database-Level Privacy
- All task queries now include `'author' => get_current_user_id()` to filter results
- Tasks are automatically assigned to the creating user via `post_author` field
- Only the task owner can view, edit, or delete their tasks
- **ALL tasks are created with 'private' status for maximum security**

### 2. Private Task Creation
- **New Enhancement**: ALL tasks (today, future, scheduled) are now created with `'private'` post status
- This ensures ALL tasks are completely invisible to other users, even admins
- Automatic migration converts existing 'publish' and 'future' status tasks to 'private'
- Task queries now search for both 'private' and legacy statuses (for compatibility)

### 2. User Interface Privacy
Updated the following files to include author restrictions:

#### Today's Tasks (`/public/partials/UI/todays-tasks.php`)
- âœ… Already included author restriction
- âœ… **Updated to query both 'private' and legacy 'publish' status tasks**
- Tasks shown only for current user

#### Future Tasks (`/public/partials/UI/future-tasks.php`)
- âœ… Added author restriction
- âœ… **Updated to query both 'private' and legacy status tasks**
- Future tasks are now completely private to each user

#### Archive Tasks (`/public/partials/UI/archive-tasks.php`)
- âœ… Already included author restriction
- âœ… **Updated to query both 'private' and legacy 'publish' status tasks**
- Archived tasks are private to each user

#### Shortcode Tasks (`/public/partials/tasks-shortcode.php`)
- âœ… Added author restriction
- âœ… **Updated to query both 'private' and legacy 'publish' status tasks**
- Shortcode now shows only user's own tasks

### 3. Enhanced Task Creation (`/includes/class-tasks-model.php`)
- âœ… **ALL tasks now created with 'private' status regardless of schedule**
- Maximum privacy protection for all tasks (today, future, scheduled)
- Backward compatibility maintained for existing tasks

### 4. Private Title Display (`/tasks.php`)
- âœ… **Automatic removal of "Private:" prefix from task titles**
- Clean task titles without WordPress's default private post formatting
- Custom filters ensure titles display normally in all contexts
- Maintains privacy while providing clean user experience

### 5. Post Type Capabilities
Updated the task post type registration (`/includes/class-tasks-post-type.php`) to include:
- Author support: `'supports' => array('title', 'editor', 'comments', 'author')`
- Custom capabilities for fine-grained control
- Meta capability mapping for WordPress permission system

### 6. AJAX Security
Enhanced all AJAX handlers in `/public/class-tasks-public.php` with ownership verification:

#### Add Subtask Handler
- Verifies user owns the parent task before allowing subtask creation
- Returns permission denied error for unauthorized access

#### Update Task Status Handler  
- Confirms task ownership before status updates
- Prevents users from modifying others' tasks

#### Update Subtask Status Handler
- Checks parent task ownership before subtask status changes
- Maintains privacy at subtask level

#### Add Comment Handler
- Restricts commenting to task owners only
- Prevents unauthorized users from adding comments

### 7. Manual Migration Process
- âœ… **Manual migration recommended for existing tasks**
- Administrator can manually update existing 'publish' and 'future' tasks to 'private' status
- Provides full control over migration timing and process
- No automatic changes to existing data
- Backward compatibility maintained for existing tasks

## Security Benefits

1. **Data Isolation**: Each user sees only their own tasks
2. **Access Control**: No user can modify another user's tasks
3. **Comment Privacy**: Comments are limited to task owners
4. **AJAX Protection**: All async operations verify ownership
5. **Database Security**: Queries filter by user ID at database level
6. **ðŸ”’ Maximum Task Privacy**: ALL tasks use 'private' status for ultimate security
7. **âœ¨ Clean Title Display**: Automatic removal of "Private:" prefix for better UX

## User Experience

- Users see only their own tasks in all views (today, future, archive)
- Task creation automatically assigns to current user
- **ALL tasks are automatically private and invisible to others**
- **Clean task titles without "Private:" prefix for better user experience**
- All task operations (edit, delete, comment) respect ownership
- Clean separation between different users' task lists
- No performance impact - queries remain efficient with author filtering
- **Manual control over existing task migration**

## Manual Migration Instructions

To manually convert existing tasks to private status:

1. **Via WordPress Admin**:
   - Go to Posts â†’ All Posts
   - Filter by 'task' post type
   - Select tasks to update
   - Use Bulk Actions â†’ Edit â†’ Status â†’ Private

2. **Via Database Query** (for advanced users):
   ```sql
   UPDATE wp_posts 
   SET post_status = 'private' 
   WHERE post_type = 'task' 
   AND post_status IN ('publish', 'future');
   ```

3. **Benefits of Manual Migration**:
   - Full control over timing
   - Review tasks before migration
   - No automatic changes
   - Custom migration criteria if needed

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions for enhanced privacy:
- Team/shared task functionality with explicit permissions
- Admin override capabilities for site administrators
- Task sharing between specific users
- Project-based access control

## Testing

To verify privacy implementation:
1. Create tasks with User A
2. Login as User B
3. Confirm User B cannot see User A's tasks
4. Test all AJAX operations return permission errors
5. Verify database queries include proper author filtering
